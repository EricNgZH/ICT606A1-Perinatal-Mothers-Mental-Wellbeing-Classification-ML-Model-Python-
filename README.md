# ICT606A1 Perinatal Mothers Mental Wellbeing Classification ML Model (Python)

This study investigates the negative impacts of risk factors on the mental health of prenatal mothers.

The data were collected through a prenatal mental risk screening program, with a quantitative survey designed to categorize people into high and low risk. The risk factors considered include common life experiences, psychological distress, incidents of familial violence, smoking habits, drug use, and difficulties related to transitional periods.

This study will be able to provide valuable insights into the mental health of prenatal mothers and the risk factors that can contribute to negative outcomes. The findings can be used to develop more effective interventions and support programs for prenatal mothers.

Summary of the project

1. Data preparation
- Performed descriptive and basic statistical analysis to identify data characteristics and requirements for rectification.
- Cleaned the data.
- Used K-fold cross-validation for train-test split due to limited observations.

2. Machine learning model development
- Researched suitable machine learning models (random forest, K-nearest neighbors, and SVM).
- Developed models and evaluated results based on accuracy and contextual criteria.

3. Performance evaluation
- Selected performance evaluation metric based on the context.
- Identified top performing feature.

4. Limitations and future improvements
- Discussed limitations of the study and suggested potential future improvements.
